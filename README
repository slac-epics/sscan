sscan Module Description (copied from sscan webpage):
This module contains the sscan record and related software for 
systematically moving positioners, triggering detectors, and acquiring and 
storing resulting data. It also contains the recDynLink library, which is 
used by the sscan and swait records to implement their links; and the busy 
record, which allows CA clients to indicate completion in a way that works 
with EPICS putNotify/ca_put_callback mechanism.

Instructions for using the sscan module in an EPICS IOC (copied from web 
documentation):
The sscan module is not intended to run an IOC application directly, but 
rather to contribute code libraries, databases, MEDM displays, etc., to an 
IOC application. SynApps contains an example IOC application (the xxx 
module), which pulls software from the sscan module and deploys it in an 
IOC.
